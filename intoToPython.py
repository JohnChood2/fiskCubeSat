Strings
 Strings can be groups of numbers or letters that are enclosed in quotes.
 Single quotes '' or double "" quotes will both work. However, if you use an apostrophe '
 Then you must enclose the apostrophe in double quotes to be be used in the string.
    For Example:
    stringVar = "This is Caleb's string, ain't it grand?"

Tuples - pronounced 2-ple
 These are a grouping of data in an immutable structure. Immutable means the length of the tuple
 (I think of it as a container is not allowed to changed)
 Tuples are enclosed in round brackets () and the values are separated by commas, the values in a tuple are
 accessed using integers starting with 0. Access that last value in the tuple starting with -1.

"""
Lists
    These a grouping of data in an mutable structure. Use a list when you data is being collected or for any other
    reason that its length might change.
    (I think of lists as a train that can have cars added or subtracted at different stations along it journey)
    Lists are enclosed in square brackets [] and the values are separated by commas, the values in a list are
    accessed using integers starting with 0. Access that last value in the list starting with -1.

Dictionaries
    A dictionary is a way to store data using key-value pairs. While a list or a tuple use an integer to access
    stored data, a dictionary value is assessed using a key, which can be an integer, string, float, or
    even more complex data types.
    Dictionaries are enclosed in curly brackets {} and have and use a colon : to link
    key:value pairs. The key value pairs are separated by commas. To get a list of all the keys
    in a given dictionary, use the .keys() method.
